# Commands

Everything you can run here, grouped by loop. Skills are invoked by name in a Claude Code session
(`/plan`, or "run the skill plan"); tools and loops from a shell.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`, also `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)

| Skill           | When                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `plan`          | start any non-trivial task: inspect, propose, wait for a yes                                           |
| `spec`          | a feature or component changes: write its spec sections first                                          |
| `build`         | implement in thin, tested slices                                                                       |
| `test`          | add or fix tests; never weaken an assertion                                                            |
| `graph`         | before changing or tracing code: `knowledge/`, then `tools/architecture/ask`, then the language server |
| `debug`         | reproduce a failure, test one hypothesis, fix its root cause and prove the regression                  |
| `sign-off`      | end a task: tests, docs and links, task state, security on sensitive diffs                             |
| `pr-review`     | a pull request is open: fresh reviewer, verified findings, one verdict comment                         |
| `ship`          | merge and release behind green CI and the deploy's own guards                                          |
| `okf-update`    | a documented fact changed: the right doc, its links, its caps                                          |
| `security-scan` | a sensitive diff, or the weekly job: `/claude-security`                                                |
| `tech-watch`    | the monthly technical watch                                                                            |
| `pr-taste`      | the owner commented on a PR: keep the durable preferences                                              |
| `retro`         | weekly or after a long session: lessons into hooks, skills and preferences                             |
| `loop-triage`   | an outer-loop finding: turn it into an issue an inner loop can fix                                     |
| `adopt`         | apply Æion Factory to an existing repository, one phase at a time                                      |

tools/knowledge/doc-links --for path/to/file          # the docs covering a file

git config --unset aeion.mode                       # back to the team flow

## Loops (`loops/orchestrator.sh`)

```bash
loops/orchestrator.sh <job> [--dry-run] [--issue N]
#   inner     fix one `agent-ready` issue: branch, PR, review (needs --issue)
#   middle    review the open pull requests that have no verdict yet
#   outer     daily read-only health: production (read-only path), CI, open findings -> issues
#   docs      daily docs drift: doc-links, knowledge-check, stale dates -> issues
#   security  weekly codebase scan with /claude-security -> issues
#   watch     monthly technical watch -> a tech-watch package via PR
#   retro     weekly lessons from sessions and PR comments -> a PR of hooks, skills, preferences
```

Every job reads `env.local`, refuses to run while `LOOPS_ENABLED=false` (except `--dry-run`), and
prints the managed command it runs. Schedules: `loops/schedules/`. The command uses
`tools/context/run` so enabled loops get the same architecture-baseline check (a warning when
absent) and the same native compaction profile. Dry-run still launches no agent or integration.

## Plugins (Claude Code)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
claude plugin install hookify@claude-plugins-official --scope project
claude plugin install skill-creator@claude-plugins-official --scope project
claude plugin install claude-security@claude-plugins-official --scope project
claude plugin marketplace add ./tools/claude-plugins --scope project      # local language servers
claude plugin install native-lsp@aeion-local --scope project
```

## Git flow

The team flow below is the default. In local mode (`git config aeion.mode local`), commit on `main`
locally; pushing is the user's call (pre-push lets it through), and the safety guards still apply.
Only the user switches the mode.

```bash
git switch develop
git commit -m "<what changed and why>"            # the pre-commit runs the checks
# in a session: run the skill pr-review, which records Review: OK for HEAD
git push origin develop                           # pre-push refuses it without that verdict
# release: skill ship (pull request develop -> main, merge commit, tag vX.Y.Z)
```
