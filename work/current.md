tasks are deleted: the commit message and knowledge/ keep what matters. Status: ACTIVE,
WAITING-OWNER, MEASURING, BLOCKED, BACKLOG. An entry is `## <title> — <STATUS>`, then the lines

## Owner browser check after the non-root deploy — WAITING-OWNER

- Owner decision: 2026-10-31, check one real browser flow after the deploy.
- State: all five services are Live on `7b72543`; the health endpoints return 200 and the logs show
  no permission errors.
- Next: open one flow in a browser (who: owner).
- Blocker: none.
- Evidence: PR #3; Render deploy `7b72543`; `deno task check`.
